# Selecting A Linux Distribuition

There are many different versions of Linux, and unlike other commercial operating systems that are controlled, distributed and supported by only one company, the core of Linux is free to distribute and use. This creates a situation in which numerous companies, organizations and individuals have developed their own specific version of the Linux operating system. When these versions are made publicly available for use, they are known as distributions.

Normally, distributions are made for specific reasons and have been tailored to address a series of concerns. There are many versions of Linux that were developed specifically to be installed on servers that receive heavy traffic, like web servers. Some distributions of Linux were developed to be used in networks where security is a priority; where sensitive information should only be accessed by a privileged few. In fact, Linux is at the core of many of today's most advanced Firewalls! There are versions of Linux that are meant to be installed on top of an existing operating system like Windows, so people can try out Linux under familiar conditions. There are versions of Linux that are designed to be installed on platforms like Macintosh.

Linux also makes its appearance in many embedded devices, like routers, switches, phone systems, smart phones, gps systems, and the list goes on and on. There are versions of Linux with funny names like Chainsaw Linux (no kidding). And, of course, there are distributions of Linux that are designed to be used as a PC Desktop operating system.

So, which Linux distribution should you use? My answer, based on over 2 years of experience with Linux and deployments, is 'it depends'. However, here are some questions that you can ask yourself when trying to select a Linux distribution.

1. is the code base stable ?
2. Is it easy to update software packages? (features like Debian's apt-get or Red Hat's yum update system)
3. Is it easy to upgrade from one major version to the next? (Long Term Support / LTS)
4. Does it have a large developer base? (translates into a large software selection to choose from)
5. if i have problem, will vendor can talk to me ?

There is no the best linux distribution, but you can chose "what do you need?". for example if you need to dially worker chose ubuntu or debian (with desktop of course), if you need stabilized for your own server you just need redhat, rocky, opensuse, ubuntu(with support cannonical) by installing without desktop, console only.By subscribing to vendor support from each distribution,you will be helped when there is a problem on your own server.
